      <description>Welcome! Welcome to my first blog, blog post, and journey into the learning of basketball analytics.
About Me I am a data analyst based out of Seattle. I grew up in the Chicagoland area and am a huge Chicago sports fan. I recently switched up my career from infrastructure/cybersecurity and have moved into a data analytics team at lululemon. I love the idea (and have loved the experience thus far) of working with data, but I want to continue to get so much better through outside, continuous learning and side projects.</description>
