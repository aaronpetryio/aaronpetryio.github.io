      <description>Introduction Welcome to week one! I&amp;rsquo;m still making my way through Basketball on Paper, but I wanted to make sure I got a blog out this week (consistency, remember?).
As I work through the book and try to build models or do analysis, I know I&amp;rsquo;ll need data. So, for this week, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how I built a basic webscraper using BeautifulSoup. The webscraper scrapes advanced team states off Basketball-Reference and saves them to a CSV for future use.</description>

      <description>Welcome! Welcome to my first blog, blog post, and journey into the learning of basketball analytics.
About Me I am a data analyst based out of Seattle. I grew up in the Chicagoland area and am a huge Chicago sports fan. I recently switched up my career from infrastructure/cybersecurity and have moved into a data analytics team at lululemon. I love the idea (and have loved the experience thus far) of working with data, but I want to continue to get so much better through outside, continuous learning and side projects.</description>
